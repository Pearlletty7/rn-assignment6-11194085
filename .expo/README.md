## A brief description 

In this React Native assignment, I developed a mobile application focused on cart management functionality. The goal was to create an app that allows users to view a list of available products, add products to their cart, remove products from their cart, and persist the cart data locally on the device.

I began by carefully recreating the provided UI mockup, utilizing various React Native components to build the necessary UI elements for the `HomeScreen` and `CartScreen`. The `HomeScreen` displayed the list of available products, while the `CartScreen` showcased the items currently in the user's cart.

A key feature of the app was the ability to add and remove products from the cart. Each product on the `HomeScreen` had an "Add to Cart" button, and the `CartScreen` included a "Remove from Cart" button for each item, allowing users to manage the contents of their cart.

To ensure the cart data persisted, I leveraged the `AsyncStorage` API provided by React Native to store the cart data locally on the device. I also incorporated error handling into the `AsyncStorage` operations to gracefully handle any issues with data retrieval or storage.

Throughout the development, I focused on creating a visually appealing and intuitive application, navigating between the `HomeScreen` and `CartScreen` using the `react-navigation` library.

This assignment challenged me to apply my React Native knowledge and skills to build a functional cart management application. I enjoyed the process of designing the user interface, implementing the core features, and ensuring the application's robustness through error handling and local data storage. This project has expanded my understanding of React Native and reinforced my ability to create mobile apps that address real-world use cases.
